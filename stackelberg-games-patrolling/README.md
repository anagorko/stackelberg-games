# Patrolling games - UAI 2024

The code for reproducing the experiments requires an installation of the SCIP solver (https://scipopt.org/), as well as installation of the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file.

In order to reproduce the results of the experiments:
1. Run the `uai_monte_carlo_experiments.py` script.
2. Run the `uai_random_experiments.py` script.
3. Run the `uai_figures.py` script.

The results can be found in the `output` directory, with `sf_results` and `random_results` subdirectories containing raw data, and the `plots` subdirectory containing the plots.
