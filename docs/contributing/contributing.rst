Contributing
============

.. note::

    To satisfy blind-review requirements, new projects are developed in forked private repositories.
    This workflow is documented in the present section.
    If you just want to run code from our public repositories, see :doc:`/experimenting/experimenting`.

The development standards that we follow were adapted from
the `Scientific Python Developer Guide <https://learn.scientific-python.org/development/>`_, which
you may refer for a detailed description of best practices for developing scientific packages.
